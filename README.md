# Smart Waste Segregation System (IoT)

![Circuit Diagram](circuit/smart-waste-segregation-circuit.png)

## Overview
The Smart Waste Segregation System is an IoT-based solution designed to automate the process of waste classification and disposal.  
The system uses sensors and a microcontroller to detect waste type and control a mechanical mechanism that directs the waste into appropriate compartments.

This project helps improve waste management efficiency and supports smart city initiatives.

## Problem Statement
Manual waste segregation is inefficient and often leads to improper recycling.  
An automated system can detect waste type and sort it into the correct category to improve recycling and reduce environmental impact.

---

## Features
- Automatic waste detection using sensors
- Motorized waste segregation mechanism
- Real-time sensor-based decision making
- Modular hardware design
- Scalable for smart waste management systems

## Working Principle
1. Waste is placed into the smart dustbin.
2. The IR sensor detects the presence of waste.
3. The rain sensor checks if the waste is wet or dry.
4. The Metal sensor checks if the waste is metal.
5. The Arduino processes the sensor input.
6. The stepper motor rotates the bin mechanism to the appropriate compartment.
7. The servo motor opens the lid and drops the waste and closes.
8. The stepper motor will return to it's original position.
